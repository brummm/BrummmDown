# How to run the examples
Since BrummmDown uses dynamic file loads (for the localization and other on demand plugins), in order to see the examples working as intended you should:
1. Run the examples on a server (rather local or online)
2. Or disable security settings to allow access to local files (pottentially dangerous, but since you are a smart developer, we are ok)

## *But how do I do that*
You must find further instructions on how to do one of the two items above in [https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/How-to-run-things-locally](here)
